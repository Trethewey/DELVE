 This pipeline was developed for the analysis of lymphoid malignancy NGS data obtained from tissue and ctDNA.
          All credit goes to the developers and creators of the programs utilised in these scripts.

 These scripts are currently in development, with significant revisions planned for packaging the analysis 
                           into one deployable program for lymphoid analysis.
